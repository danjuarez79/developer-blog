# Daniel's Developer Blog

## Welcome to my first blog

I chose to start this blog as a place to practice writing in markdown. My goal is to write down any knowledge gained as I go and have it posted somewhere to quickly share links to online. The topics are how-to's and things like best practices lessons learned and anything else relevant to the journey of a full stack cloud development professional.
